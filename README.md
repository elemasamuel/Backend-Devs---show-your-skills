## About
The `harsh_generator.py` is the file that hashes the values in `HNGi9 CSV FILE - Sheet1.csv`, creates a new file called `filename.output.csv` and appends the hashed values to the old code in the newly created `filename.output.csv`.

The `csvToJson.py` is the file that converts the csv files in `filename.output.csv` file to a json format `filename.output.json`.

## Guidelines
* Type ```python harsh_generator.py``` in your terminal to hash the values in `HNGi9 CSV FILE - Sheet1.csv` and append them in the automatically created `filename.output.csv` file 
* Type ```python csvToJson.py``` also in your terminal to convert the csv files in `filename.output.csv` file to a json format `filename.output.json`
